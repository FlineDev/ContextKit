# Subagent: check-accessibility

**Purpose**: Analyze iOS/macOS UI code for accessibility compliance following constitutional accessibility-first principles and suggest specific improvements with validation gates.

**Context Requirements**: 
- Project files (SwiftUI views, UIKit controllers, storyboards)
- Current feature specifications and design context
- Target platform (iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS)
- Constitutional compliance requirements

## Execution Flow (subagent)

1. **Parse Input Context**
   â†’ Extract: target platform, analyzed files, feature context
   â†’ If no files provided: ERROR "No UI code files specified for accessibility analysis"

2. **Detect UI Framework Patterns**
   â†’ SwiftUI: Scan for View implementations and accessibility modifiers
   â†’ UIKit: Analyze view controllers, interface builder files, programmatic UI
   â†’ If framework unclear: WARN "Mixed framework usage detected" + analyze both

3. **Analyze Accessibility Implementation**
   â†’ VoiceOver Support: Check for accessibility labels, hints, values
   â†’ Semantic Markup: Verify proper accessibility roles and traits
   â†’ Dynamic Type: Assess text scaling and layout adaptability
   â†’ Color Contrast: Analyze color schemes and contrast ratios
   â†’ Keyboard Navigation: Check focusability and navigation order
   â†’ Motion Sensitivity: Evaluate animations and transitions

4. **Check Constitutional Compliance**
   â†’ Accessibility-First Principle: Verify accessibility was designed in, not added after
   â†’ If accessibility appears retrofitted: FLAG "Post-hoc accessibility implementation detected"

5. **Generate Improvement Recommendations**
   â†’ Critical Issues: Missing fundamental accessibility features (MUST FIX)
   â†’ Standards Compliance: WCAG 2.1 AA and platform-specific guideline gaps (SHOULD FIX)
   â†’ Best Practices: Enhancement opportunities for inclusive design (COULD IMPROVE)

6. **Validate Recommendations Quality**
   â†’ Each suggestion includes specific code examples
   â†’ Testing guidance provided for manual verification
   â†’ Severity levels assigned appropriately

7. **Return Structured Report**
   â†’ Issues organized by severity with file locations
   â†’ Specific code suggestions with before/after examples
   â†’ Testing checklist for VoiceOver and Accessibility Inspector validation

# Accessibility Analysis Report

**Analysis Summary**: ${ANALYZED_FILES_COUNT} files analyzed for ${TARGET_PLATFORM} accessibility compliance

## Constitutional Validation Results
- [ ] Accessibility-first design principles followed?
- [ ] Inclusive design patterns implemented from the start?
- [ ] Platform accessibility guidelines integrated?

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Release)
*These issues prevent basic accessibility functionality*

### Missing VoiceOver Labels
**File**: `LoginView.swift:42`
**Issue**: Button lacks accessibility label
```swift
// Current (inaccessible)
Button("ðŸ‘¤") { ... }

// Fix (accessible)
Button("ðŸ‘¤") { ... }
.accessibilityLabel("Sign in to your account")
```
**Testing**: Enable VoiceOver and verify button announces "Sign in to your account"

### Color-Only Information
**File**: `StatusIndicator.swift:18`
**Issue**: Status conveyed only through color (red/green indicators)
**Solution**: Add text labels or SF Symbols alongside colors
```swift
// Add text or symbols to color indicators
HStack {
    Image(systemName: isOnline ? "checkmark.circle.fill" : "xmark.circle.fill")
    Text(isOnline ? "Online" : "Offline")
}
.foregroundColor(isOnline ? .green : .red)
```

## Recommendations (Should Fix)
*These improve accessibility experience significantly*

### Dynamic Type Support
**File**: `TitleView.swift:25`
**Issue**: Fixed font size prevents text scaling
```swift
// Current (not scalable)
.font(.system(size: 24, weight: .bold))

// Recommended (scalable)
.font(.title2.weight(.bold))
```
**Testing**: Test with largest accessibility text size in Settings

### Insufficient Color Contrast
**File**: `SecondaryButton.swift:33`
**Issue**: Text contrast ratio 3.1:1 (below 4.5:1 minimum)
**Solution**: Use semantic colors or increase contrast
```swift
// Use semantic colors that adapt to accessibility settings
.foregroundColor(.primary)
.background(.secondary)
```

## Best Practices (Could Improve)
*These enhance inclusive design and user experience*

### Accessibility Hints for Complex Gestures
**File**: `SwipeableCard.swift:15`
**Enhancement**: Add hints for custom gestures
```swift
.accessibilityHint("Swipe left to delete, right to archive")
```

### Reduce Motion Considerations
**File**: `AnimatedTransition.swift:28`
**Enhancement**: Respect reduce motion preference
```swift
.animation(
    UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled ? nil : .spring(),
    value: isExpanded
)
```

### Accessibility Identifiers for Testing
**File**: `LoginForm.swift:all`
**Enhancement**: Add accessibility identifiers for UI testing
```swift
.accessibilityIdentifier("login_email_field")
.accessibilityIdentifier("login_password_field")
.accessibilityIdentifier("login_submit_button")
```

## Accessibility Testing Checklist

### VoiceOver Testing
- [ ] Enable VoiceOver (Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver)
- [ ] Navigate entire user flow using only VoiceOver
- [ ] Verify all interactive elements are discoverable
- [ ] Check that labels are descriptive and contextual
- [ ] Ensure reading order is logical

### Visual Testing  
- [ ] Test with largest text size (Settings > Display & Brightness > Text Size)
- [ ] Verify layout adapts without truncation or overlap
- [ ] Test in high contrast mode (Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size)
- [ ] Check color contrast with Accessibility Inspector

### Motor Accessibility
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation (external keyboard on iPad)
- [ ] Verify all interactive elements are focusable
- [ ] Check tap target sizes meet 44pt minimum
- [ ] Test Switch Control if supporting advanced motor accessibility

### Cognitive Accessibility
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Check timeout warnings are provided for timed interactions
- [ ] Ensure complex interactions can be completed step-by-step

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### iOS/iPadOS Specific
- App Store Review: Ensure compliance with App Store Review Guidelines 1.2 (accessibility)
- Privacy Labels: Include accessibility data usage if analyzing user accessibility preferences

### macOS Specific  
- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard access must be supported
- Menu bar accessibility: Ensure proper role and label implementation
- Window management: VoiceOver navigation within windows

### tvOS Specific
- Focus engine integration: Ensure proper focusability
- Siri Remote accessibility: Voice control compatibility

## Code Quality Gates

### Pre-Implementation Accessibility Gates
- [ ] Accessibility requirements defined in feature specification?
- [ ] Accessibility labels planned for all interactive elements?
- [ ] Color contrast validated for all color schemes?
- [ ] Dynamic Type support designed into layout?

### Post-Implementation Validation Gates
- [ ] All interactive elements have appropriate accessibility labels?
- [ ] Custom controls implement UIAccessibility protocols correctly?
- [ ] Color is not the only means of conveying information?
- [ ] Text scales properly with Dynamic Type settings?
- [ ] VoiceOver navigation order is logical and complete?

**Constitutional Compliance**: This analysis enforces accessibility-first design principles where accessibility is built into the foundation of the user interface rather than retrofitted as an afterthought.

- `/Implement/commit-changes` can validate accessibility before commits

### Constitutional Enforcement
- Enforces "accessibility-first design" constitutional principle
- Validates that accessibility is designed in from the start
- Flags retroactive accessibility implementations as constitutional violations

### Quality Assurance Integration
- Integrates with build-project subagent for comprehensive code quality
- Coordinates with check-localization for accessible localized content
- Works with check-modern-code to ensure modern accessibility APIs
