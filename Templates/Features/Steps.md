# Feature Steps: ${FEATURE_NAME}

**Phase**: 2 (Implementation Plan)  
**Input**: Technical plan from Tech.md  
**Prerequisites**: Spec.md (business case), Tech.md (architecture)  
**Purpose**: Break down feature into executable tasks with parallel markers and dependency tracking

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load technical plan from Tech.md
   → If missing: ERROR "Technical plan required - run /Plan/define-tech first"
   → Extract: architecture decisions, file locations, dependencies
2. Analyze plan complexity and scope
   → Count: new files, modified files, new APIs, tests needed
   → If scope > 20 tasks: WARN "Consider breaking into smaller features"
3. Apply task generation rules:
   → One task per file creation/modification
   → One task per API endpoint
   → One task per data model
   → One task per significant UI component
4. Generate tasks with S### enumeration (S001, S002...)
   → Setup tasks: Project structure, dependencies, configuration
   → Model tasks: Data layer implementation (TDD - tests first)
   → Service tasks: Business logic and API integration
   → UI tasks: SwiftUI views, navigation, user interaction
   → Integration tasks: End-to-end flows and validation
   → Polish tasks: Accessibility, localization, performance
5. Apply parallel execution markers [P]:
   → Different files = [P] parallel safe
   → Same file = sequential only
   → Independent components = [P] parallel safe
   → Shared resources = sequential only
6. Validate dependency chains:
   → Models before Services before UI
   → Tests can run parallel with implementation
   → Configuration before usage
   → Critical path identified and documented
7. Run iOS-specific task validation:
   → Privacy manifest updates included?
   → Accessibility implementation planned?
   → Localization tasks identified?
   → App Store compliance verified?
8. Generate completion verification checklist
9. Return: SUCCESS (implementation plan ready for execution)
```

## Task Generation Rules

### Rule 1: One Task Per File/Entity
- **File Creation**: Each new Swift file = separate task
- **File Modification**: Significant changes to existing file = separate task  
- **API Endpoints**: Each endpoint implementation = separate task
- **Data Models**: Each model class/struct = separate task
- **UI Components**: Each significant view = separate task

### Rule 2: Parallel Execution Safety
- **[P] Parallel Safe**: Different files, independent components, no shared state
- **Sequential Required**: Same file, shared resources, dependent functionality
- **Test Parallelism**: Tests can run [P] with their implementation counterparts

### Rule 3: iOS-Specific Task Types
- **Privacy Tasks**: Manifest updates, permission requests, data handling
- **Accessibility Tasks**: VoiceOver labels, dynamic type, keyboard navigation  
- **Localization Tasks**: String extraction, TranslateKit integration
- **Performance Tasks**: Memory optimization, render performance, battery usage
- **App Store Tasks**: Guidelines compliance, metadata updates, submission prep

### Rule 4: Dependency Chain Validation

## Dependency Chain Validation

### Critical Path Analysis
**Longest Dependency Chain**: S001 → S002 → S007-S009 → S013-S014 → S017-S018 → S019 → S020-S021 → S026-S027 → S030

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Models (S007-S009) can implement in parallel after tests (S004-S006)
- Services (S013-S014) can implement in parallel if independent  
- UI Views (S017-S018) can implement in parallel if non-interactive
- Quality gates (S022-S024) can run in parallel during integration phase
- Polish tasks (S025, S028-S029) can run in parallel in final phase

### iOS Development Dependencies
**Architectural Layers**:
- SwiftUI Views depend on ViewModels/Services for data
- Services depend on Models for data structures
- All layers depend on ErrorKit for error handling
- Localization depends on TranslateKit integration
- Privacy compliance depends on data flow understanding

**Platform-Specific Dependencies**:
- Privacy manifest (S026) requires understanding of data usage from services
- Accessibility implementation (S022) requires UI structure from views
- App Store submission (S027) requires feature completion and testing
- Performance optimization (S025) requires full implementation for profiling

- "App Store compliance" → Feature may violate App Store Review Guidelines  
- "Performance concerns" → Implementation may cause performance degradation

**Constitutional Errors**:  
- "Package architecture violation" → Feature doesn't follow package-first principles
- "Error handling incomplete" → ErrorKit patterns not properly integrated
- "Code quality issues" → Implementation doesn't follow constitutional style
- "Localization missing" → TranslateKit integration not properly planned

## For AI Generation

When creating implementation steps from a technical plan:

1. **Apply Task Generation Rules**: Follow one-task-per-file/entity rule strictly
2. **Mark Parallel Safety**: Use [P] only for truly independent tasks
3. **Include iOS Specifics**: Privacy, accessibility, localization, App Store compliance
4. **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure logical order and no circular dependencies  
5. **Constitutional Integration**: ErrorKit, 3-space style, package architecture
6. **Quality Gates**: Build validation, testing, subagent checks

### Common iOS Task Patterns
```
Setup → Models (TDD) → Services → UI → Integration → Polish → Release
  ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
S001    S004-S009   S011-S014  S015-S019  S020-S024   S025-S029  S030
```

### Parallel Execution Examples
- **Models**: Different model files can implement [P] in parallel  
- **Services**: Independent services can implement [P] in parallel
- **UI Views**: Non-interacting views can implement [P] in parallel
- **Tests**: Tests can run [P] with their implementation counterparts
- **Quality**: Accessibility, localization, error handling checks can run [P]

**IMPORTANT**: This template creates the implementation roadmap. Each S### task should be specific enough to execute without ambiguity while maintaining proper dependency order and parallel execution opportunities.
