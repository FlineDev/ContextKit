║ 🤖 EXECUTION FLOW - FEATURE SPECIFICATION GENERATION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ ## Execution Flow (main)
║ ```
║ 1. Parse user description from Input
║   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
║ 2. Apply iOS/macOS constitutional principles
║   → Accessibility-first design mandatory
║   → Privacy by design enforced  
║   → Platform UX guidelines required
║ 3. Extract key concepts from description
║   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
║   → Consider platform-specific patterns (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
║ 4. For each unclear aspect:
║   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific iOS/macOS question]
║   → Common gaps: user auth method, data persistence, platform targets
║ 5. Generate iOS/macOS user scenarios
║   → Include accessibility scenarios (VoiceOver, Switch Control)
║   → Account for different screen sizes and orientations
║   → Consider multi-platform usage patterns
║ 6. Create functional requirements with iOS/macOS context
║   → Privacy manifest considerations embedded
║   → App Store review guidelines compliance checked
║   → Platform-specific capabilities assessed (CloudKit, HealthKit, etc.)
║ 7. Run iOS/macOS validation gates
║   → App Store compliance check
║   → Privacy impact assessment
║   → Accessibility requirement verification
║   → Localization readiness review
║ 8. Anti-speculation enforcement
║   → No "nice to have" features without clear user value
║   → Each feature must solve specific problem
║   → Implementation cost vs benefit considered
║ 9. Self-validation checklist execution
║   → All mandatory sections complete
║   → No ambiguous requirements remain
║   → Constitutional principles satisfied
║ 10. Return: SUCCESS (iOS/macOS spec ready for technical planning)
║ ```
║
║ ## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
║
║ - ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
║ - ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
║ - 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers
║ - 🍎 iOS/macOS platform conventions and constitutional principles enforced
║
║ ### Section Requirements
║ - Mandatory sections: Must be completed for every feature
║ - Optional sections: Include only when relevant to the feature
║ - When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
║
║ ### For AI Generation
║ When creating this spec from a user prompt:
║ 1. Mark all ambiguities: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any
║   assumption you'd need to make
║ 2. Don't guess: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "user
║   authentication" without method), mark it
║ 3. Think like a tester: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and
║   unambiguous" checklist item
║ 4. iOS/macOS specifics: Consider platform differences, device capabilities,
║   App Store requirements
║ 5. Common underspecified areas:
║   - User authentication method (Apple ID, email/password, OAuth)
║   - Data persistence approach (local CoreData, CloudKit sync, both)
║   - Target platforms (iOS only, universal, macOS specific)
║   - Performance targets and scale expectations
║   - Privacy data usage and collection policies
║   - Accessibility requirements beyond basic compliance
║   - Localization scope and target languages
║   - Integration requirements with platform services

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a [User Type], I want to [User Goal] so that [User Benefit].

**iOS/macOS Context**: 
- Accessibility: How does this work with VoiceOver, Switch Control, or Assistive Touch?
- Multi-platform: How does the experience differ between iPhone, iPad, and Mac?
- Privacy: What personal data is involved and how is user consent obtained?

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [Scenario Context], **When** [User Action], **Then** [Expected Outcome]
   - **Happy Path**: Normal successful usage
   - **Error Path**: What happens when things go wrong
   - **Accessibility Path**: How assistive technologies interact
   - **Privacy Path**: User data protection and consent flows

2. **Given** [Additional Context], **When** [Different Action], **Then** [Different Outcome]
   - Include different device contexts (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
   - Consider different user capabilities and preferences
   - Account for network conditions and offline scenarios

### Edge Cases
- **Platform variations**: iPhone vs iPad vs Mac specific behaviors
- **Accessibility scenarios**: VoiceOver navigation, voice control, reduced motion
- **Privacy edge cases**: User denies permissions, data export requests, account deletion
- **Multi-device usage**: Handoff, Continuity, CloudKit sync conflicts
- **App lifecycle**: Background processing, memory pressure, system interruptions
- **Localization**: Right-to-left languages, different date/number formats, cultural differences

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

*Each requirement must be:*
- Testable with clear success/failure criteria

**IMPORTANT**: This specification should remain high-level and readable. Any detailed technical implementations, code samples, or extensive technical specifications must be placed in separate implementation detail files in the Context/Features/[feature-name]/TechDetails/ directory during the technical planning phase.

**Command Arguments Used**:
- `$ARGUMENTS` - Original user input (e.g., "Add user authentication with Apple ID")
- AI generates feature name from `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., "UserAuthentication")
- AI creates kebab-case branch name (e.g., "user-authentication") 
- AI fills in current date and extracts user story components

**Next Phase**: After this specification is approved, proceed to `/ctxk:plan:2-tech` for technical architecture planning with constitutional compliance validation.
