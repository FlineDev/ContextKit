## Description
Capture new app ideas with structured evaluation framework, constitutional principle assessment, and priority context following spec-kit methodology

## Parameters
- `description` (required): Brief description of the idea or feature concept

## Execution Flow (main)
1. Parse and validate idea description
   → If empty: ERROR "Idea description required"
   → If too vague: ERROR "Description must be specific and actionable"
   → Extract key concepts: user benefit, technical scope, complexity indicators
   → Identify actors, actions, and potential value proposition
2. Detect project context for idea assessment
   → Load Context.md to determine project type and architecture
   → If Context.md missing: ERROR "Must run in valid ContextKit project"
   → Identify existing features and technical capabilities from codebase
   → Assess alignment with project goals and user base
   → Load workspace context from parent directories if available
3. Generate idea metadata and classification
   → Create unique idea identifier: IDEA-${YEAR}-${SEQUENCE} (e.g., IDEA-2025-001)
   → Extract or generate clear idea title from description
   → Apply idea classification (feature, enhancement, performance, refactor, research, infrastructure)
   → Estimate initial effort level (Small, Medium, Large, XL) based on complexity indicators
4. Apply constitutional principle pre-assessment (mandatory gates)
   → **Accessibility Gate**: Assess UI impact, interaction models, assistive technology requirements
   → **Privacy Gate**: Evaluate data collection, storage, consent, and sharing implications
   → **Localizability Gate**: Analyze user-facing content, cultural sensitivity, technical complexity
   → **Maintainability Gate**: Review architecture impact, dependencies, code complexity, testing needs
   → If any gate assessment incomplete: ERROR "Constitutional assessment required for all relevant areas"
5. Create structured idea documentation
   → Ensure Context/Backlog/Ideas/ directory exists
   → Generate Context/Backlog/Ideas/${IDEA_ID}.md with complete evaluation framework
   → Include constitutional principle considerations and requirements
   → Document user value proposition, success criteria, and measurable outcomes
   → Identify potential dependencies, prerequisites, and integration points
6. Update backlog management system
   → Add entry to Context/Backlog/Index.md with metadata summary
   → Update Context/Backlog/Prioritization.md with new item for ranking
   → Tag idea with relevant categories (UI, Backend, Performance, API, etc.)
   → Link to related existing features or technical components
7. Generate implementation readiness assessment
   → Identify information gaps requiring clarification before specification
   → Suggest research tasks or technical spikes if needed
   → Propose next steps for idea refinement and validation
   → Mark constitutional principle areas requiring detailed planning during /Plan/create-spec
8. Run validation gates before completion
   → Verify all mandatory sections filled with specific, actionable content
   → Confirm constitutional assessment covers all relevant areas
   → Ensure user value proposition is clear and measurable
   → Validate technical considerations identify key integration points
   → Check that questions and uncertainties are specific and answerable
9. Return: SUCCESS (idea captured with constitutional assessment and prioritization context)

## Idea Classification System

### Idea Types
```swift
enum IdeaType {
   case feature          // New user-facing functionality
   case enhancement     // Improvement to existing functionality
   case performance     // Performance optimization or improvement
   case refactor        // Code quality or architecture improvement
   case research        // Technical research or experimentation
   case infrastructure  // Development tooling or process improvement
}
```

### Effort Estimation Guidelines
```swift
enum EffortLevel {
   case small    // 1-3 days, single developer, minimal risk, clear implementation path
   case medium   // 1-2 weeks, may need collaboration, moderate complexity, some unknowns
   case large    // 2-6 weeks, team effort, significant complexity, major integration points
   case xl       // >6 weeks, major initiative, high complexity, architectural changes
}
```

## Backlog Management Integration

### Context/Backlog/Index.md Updates
Automatically adds entry to maintain centralized idea tracking:
```markdown
| ID | Title | Type | Effort | Status | Constitutional Impact | Created | Priority |
|----|-------|------|--------|--------|--------------------|---------|----------|
| ${IDEA_ID} | ${IDEA_TITLE} | ${IDEA_TYPE} | ${EFFORT_ESTIMATE} | Idea | ${CONSTITUTIONAL_IMPACT_SUMMARY} | ${CREATION_DATE} | Not Set |
```

### Context/Backlog/Prioritization.md Integration
Adds to unprioritized section for systematic ranking:
```markdown
## Unprioritized Ideas (use /Backlog/prioritize-backlog to rank)

### ${IDEA_ID}: ${IDEA_TITLE}
- **Type**: ${IDEA_TYPE} | **Effort**: ${EFFORT_ESTIMATE}
- **Value**: [Needs assessment - user impact, business value, strategic alignment]
- **Risk**: [Needs assessment - technical complexity, resource requirements, unknowns]
- **Constitutional**: ${CONSTITUTIONAL_IMPACT_SUMMARY}
- **Dependencies**: [List prerequisite items or blockers]
```

## Validation Gates
All gates must pass before command completion:
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Description clear, specific, and actionable?
- [ ] **Context Validation**: Valid ContextKit project with accessible Context.md?
- [ ] **Classification Complete**: Type and effort level appropriately assigned?
- [ ] **Constitutional Assessment**: All relevant constitutional principles assessed with specific requirements?
- [ ] **Value Proposition Clear**: User benefit and success criteria well-defined and measurable?
- [ ] **Technical Considerations**: Key technologies, integrations, and risks identified?
- [ ] **Documentation Complete**: All template sections filled with actionable content?
- [ ] **Backlog Integration**: Index and prioritization files properly updated?
- [ ] **Next Steps Defined**: Clear, specific actions for moving idea forward?

## Error Conditions
- **"Empty description"** → Must provide meaningful, specific idea description
- **"Description too vague"** → Description must include enough detail for evaluation and classification
- **"Context unavailable"** → Must be run in valid ContextKit project directory with Context.md
- **"Constitutional assessment incomplete"** → Must assess all relevant constitutional principles with specific requirements
- **"Duplicate idea detected"** → Similar idea already exists in backlog (suggest linking or merging)
- **"Invalid project state"** → Project context corrupted, missing, or incompatible with idea capture
- **"Directory creation failed"** → Unable to create required Context/Backlog/Ideas/ directory structure
- **"Template substitution failed"** → Unable to resolve required template variables or generate content
- **"Validation gate failure"** → One or more validation gates failed - specific guidance provided for resolution

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Idea-to-Implementation Pipeline
1. **Capture** → Use `/Backlog/add-idea` for initial capture with constitutional pre-assessment
2. **Research** → Conduct technical spikes, user research, or competitive analysis as identified in Next Steps
3. **Prioritization** → Use `/Backlog/prioritize-backlog` for systematic ranking against other items
4. **Specification** → Use `/Plan/create-spec` when ready for detailed implementation planning
5. **Implementation** → Follow standard ContextKit development workflow (/Plan → /Implement commands)

### Constitutional Principle Evolution Through Workflow
- **Ideas**: Pre-assessment identifies constitutional areas requiring attention
- **Specification**: Constitutional requirements become detailed implementation requirements
- **Technical Planning**: Constitutional compliance becomes explicit architectural decisions
- **Implementation**: Constitutional validation becomes quality gates and testing requirements
- **Release**: Constitutional compliance becomes verification criteria and documentation

### Quality Assurance Integration
- Ideas with "Major" or "Critical" constitutional impact automatically flagged for architectural review
- Constitutional assessment guides selection of appropriate agents during implementation
- Quality gates ensure constitutional principles addressed before idea progression to specification phase
