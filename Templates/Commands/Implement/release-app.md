# Command: /Implement/release-app

## Description
Execute comprehensive iOS/macOS app release workflow with constitutional compliance, App Store Connect integration, and automatic localization

## Parameters
- `version` (required): Semantic version for release (e.g., "1.2.0")
- `dry_run` (optional): Preview changes without executing (default: false)
- `target_platform` (optional): ios, macos, visionos - defaults to detecting from project

## Execution Flow (main)
1. Validate release prerequisites and development state
   ‚Üí Check that development session is complete (/Implement/start-working completed)
   ‚Üí Verify this is an iOS/macOS app project (*.xcodeproj present)
   ‚Üí Ensure git working directory is clean with all changes committed
   ‚Üí Confirm Xcode Cloud is configured for automatic builds
   ‚Üí If not app project: ERROR "Use /Implement/release-package for Swift packages"
   ‚Üí If uncommitted changes: ERROR "Commit all changes before release"
2. Analyze changes since last release for What's New content
   ‚Üí Find latest git tag using semantic version sorting: `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1`
   ‚Üí Extract commits between last tag and HEAD with full diffs: `git log --oneline LAST_TAG..HEAD`
   ‚Üí Review each commit individually: `git show COMMIT_HASH` for complete change analysis
   ‚Üí Focus on user-facing changes: new features, UI improvements, notable bug fixes
   ‚Üí Exclude internal changes: technical debt, code refactoring, dependency updates
   ‚Üí If no user-facing changes: ASK "Create maintenance release anyway?"
3. Generate comprehensive release documentation with App Store Connect text
   ‚Üí Create AssistantContext/Projects/[ProjectName]/Releases/[Version].md
   ‚Üí Include detailed analysis of user-facing changes with constitutional compliance review
   ‚Üí Generate App Store Connect-ready What's New text in structured format
   ‚Üí Mark accessibility improvements, privacy enhancements, localization updates
   ‚Üí Apply Release.md guidelines for user-facing vs technical change categorization
   ‚Üí If documentation generation fails: ERROR "Unable to analyze changes for release"
4. Execute constitutional compliance validation (blocking gates)
   ‚Üí Execute accessibility subagent: VoiceOver labels, color contrast, keyboard navigation
   ‚Üí Execute privacy subagent: Privacy manifest accuracy, data usage compliance, encryption
   ‚Üí Execute localization subagent: String externalization, cultural appropriateness, formatters
   ‚Üí Execute maintainability subagent: Code quality, error handling, documentation
   ‚Üí If any blocking violations found: ERROR with specific remediation guidance
   ‚Üí If warning violations found: DOCUMENT in release notes but allow release
5. Update project version following Release.md guidelines
   ‚Üí Update MARKETING_VERSION in project.pbxproj for Debug and Release configurations
   ‚Üí Keep CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION at "1" (Xcode Cloud handles build numbers automatically)
   ‚Üí Verify version consistency across all build configurations
   ‚Üí Validate privacy manifest is current for any new data usage patterns
   ‚Üí If version update fails: ERROR "Version update conflicts with project structure"
6. Execute git workflow and Xcode Cloud preparation
   ‚Üí Commit version changes with "Bump version num" message following GitCommit.md
   ‚Üí Create local git tag with semantic version: `git tag ${VERSION}`
   ‚Üí Prepare for remote push (user handles push to trigger Xcode Cloud)
   ‚Üí Validate git repository is ready for automated build process
   ‚Üí If git operations fail: ERROR "Git workflow failed - resolve conflicts"
7. Prepare automatic localization workflow with TranslateKit
   ‚Üí Detect supported languages in project String Catalog
   ‚Üí Generate localized What's New text using TranslateKit integration
   ‚Üí Format localized content for App Store Connect API submission
   ‚Üí Validate translations for cultural appropriateness and technical accuracy
   ‚Üí Create structured localized release notes in documentation
   ‚Üí If localization fails: WARN "Manual translation required for international markets"
8. Validate App Store Connect readiness and submission requirements
   ‚Üí Check app identifier and provisioning profiles are current
   ‚Üí Verify privacy manifest completeness for App Store Review Guidelines
   ‚Üí Confirm app submission requirements: screenshots, metadata, age ratings updated
   ‚Üí Validate Human Interface Guidelines compliance for new features
   ‚Üí Generate direct App Store Connect submission guidance
   ‚Üí If validation fails: WARN "Address App Store Connect issues before submission"
9. Finalize release process and provide post-release guidance
   ‚Üí Summarize all constitutional compliance validation results
   ‚Üí Provide clear next steps for user: push commits/tags, monitor Xcode Cloud
   ‚Üí Generate social media post templates following SocialMedia.md guidelines
   ‚Üí Create App Store Connect submission checklist with localized content
   ‚Üí Document release timeline and monitoring requirements
10. Return: SUCCESS (release prepared, Xcode Cloud ready, App Store Connect integration complete)
