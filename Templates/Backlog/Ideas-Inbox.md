## Quick Capture Guidelines

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🤖 EXECUTION FLOW - IDEA CAPTURE PROCESSING
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ ### For AI Processing
║ When adding ideas to this inbox:
║ 1. **Capture immediately**: Don't evaluate during capture - just record the idea
║ 2. **Include context**: Why now? What problem does this solve? Who benefits?
║ 3. **Mark uncertainties**: Use [NEEDS RESEARCH: specific question] for unclear aspects
║ 4. **Constitutional check**: Does this align with accessibility-first, privacy, localizability principles?
║
║ ### Evaluation Framework
║ Each idea should eventually include:
║ - **User Value**: Clear benefit statement for target users
║ - **Effort Estimate**: T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL) 
║ - **Constitutional Alignment**: How does this support core principles?
║ - **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?

## Instructions for `/Backlog/add-idea`

This template is used by the `/Backlog/add-idea [description]` command to:
1. Generate unique idea ID (IDEA-001, IDEA-002, etc.)
2. Capture idea with timestamp and context
3. Apply evaluation framework structure
4. Add to this inbox for later prioritization
5. Trigger constitutional compliance review

The idea will remain here until `/Backlog/prioritize-ideas` is run to evaluate and potentially promote it to the active backlog.
