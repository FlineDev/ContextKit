║ ## Prioritization Framework
║
║ ### Priority Levels
║ - **🔴 Critical**: Constitutional violations, blocking accessibility, major user pain points
║ - **🟡 High**: Significant user value, strategic alignment, competitive advantage
║ - **🔵 Medium**: Nice to have, good user experience improvement, technical debt reduction
║ - **⚪ Low**: Future consideration, experimental ideas, optimization opportunities
║ - **⚫ Deferred**: Good ideas for later, insufficient resources, strategic misalignment
║
║ ### Effort Sizing
║ - **XS**: 1-2 hours, single file change, configuration adjustment
║ - **S**: Half day to 1 day, small feature, minor UI improvement
║ - **M**: 2-5 days, medium feature, multiple file changes, some complexity
║ - **L**: 1-2 weeks, major feature, architectural changes, significant testing
║ - **XL**: 2+ weeks, large initiative, cross-cutting changes, extensive validation

## 🔴 Critical Priority

### High Impact, Must Do
Ideas addressing constitutional violations or critical user needs

---

## 🟡 High Priority  

### Strategic Alignment, Significant Value
Ideas that advance core user value and strategic objectives

---

## 🔵 Medium Priority

### Good Ideas, Decent Value
Ideas that would improve the user experience but aren't urgent

---

## ⚪ Low Priority

### Future Consideration
Ideas that could be valuable but aren't currently aligned with priorities

---

## ⚫ Deferred

### On Hold
Ideas that are good but require resources or timing not currently available

### Reason for Deferral
- **Resource Constraints**: Not enough development capacity
- **Strategic Timing**: Good idea, wrong timing for product strategy
- **Technical Dependencies**: Requires other work to be completed first
- **Market Validation**: Needs user research or market validation first
