# Bugs Backlog: ${PROJECT_NAME}
<!-- Template Version: 0 | ContextKit: 0.0.0 | Updated: 2025-09-13 -->

**Project**: ${PROJECT_NAME}  
**Last Updated**: ${SETUP_DATE}  
**Purpose**: Triaged bug backlog with severity-based organization  
**Usage**: Organized by `/Backlog/prioritize-bugs` command with impact assessment

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🤖 EXECUTION FLOW - BUG TRIAGE PROCESSING
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ ## Triage Framework
║
║ ### Severity Levels
║ - **🔴 Critical**: App-breaking, data loss, security issues, constitutional violations
║ - **🟡 High**: Major functionality broken, significant user impact, accessibility barriers
║ - **🔵 Medium**: Minor functionality issues, cosmetic problems with UX impact
║ - **⚪ Low**: Edge cases, minor cosmetic issues, optimization opportunities
║
║ ### Fix Effort Sizing
║ - **XS**: 15-30 minutes, typo fix, configuration change
║ - **S**: 1-4 hours, single file fix, simple logic correction
║ - **M**: Half day to 1 day, multi-file changes, moderate complexity
║ - **L**: 2-3 days, complex fix, architectural changes, extensive testing
║ - **XL**: 1+ weeks, major refactoring, system-wide changes, comprehensive fixes

## 🔴 Critical Severity

### Immediate Attention Required
Bugs causing crashes, data loss, security issues, or constitutional violations

---

## 🟡 High Severity

### Next Sprint Priority
Major functionality issues significantly impacting user workflows

---

## 🔵 Medium Severity

### Planned Fixes
Minor functionality issues and cosmetic problems affecting user experience

---

## ⚪ Low Severity

### Future Consideration
Edge cases and minor issues that can be addressed when resources permit

---

## Constitutional Violation Tracking

### 🚨 Accessibility Violations (Critical)
Bugs preventing users with disabilities from accessing core functionality

### 🔒 Privacy Violations (Critical)
Bugs exposing user data or violating privacy expectations and regulations

### 🌍 Localization Violations (High)
Bugs affecting international users or cultural adaptation requirements

### 🏗️ Maintainability Issues (Medium-High)
Bugs indicating poor code quality, technical debt, or architecture problems

---

## Fix Planning

### Hotfix Pipeline (Critical Only)
Immediate fixes for critical issues that cannot wait for regular release cycle

### Sprint Planning
Integration of bug fixes into regular development sprint cycles

### Batch Fixes
Grouping related bugs for efficient resolution (same component, similar root cause)

### Dependency Tracking
Bugs blocked by other fixes, architecture changes, or external factors

---

## Impact Analysis

**Last Analysis**: ${SETUP_DATE}  
**Analyst**: Development team  
**Methodology**: Severity × Frequency × Constitutional Impact

### High-Impact Bug Patterns
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver navigation failures, color contrast issues
- **Performance**: Memory leaks, CPU spikes, unresponsive UI
- **Data Integrity**: Sync failures, data corruption, loss scenarios
- **Security**: Privacy manifest violations, unauthorized access

### User Feedback Correlation
- **App Store Reviews**: Bugs mentioned in user reviews
- **Support Tickets**: Common issues reported through customer support
- **Crash Analytics**: Most frequent crashes and error patterns
- **Accessibility Feedback**: Issues reported by users with disabilities

---

## Fix Strategy

### Root Cause Analysis
Systematic investigation of bug patterns to address underlying issues

### Prevention Measures
Process improvements, code review guidelines, automated testing to prevent recurrence

### Quality Gates
Testing requirements, code review criteria, constitutional compliance checks before fixes

---

## Promotion Criteria (Bugs-Inbox → Bugs-Backlog)

Bugs are promoted from inbox when they:
1. Have complete triage assessment (severity, impact, effort, constitutional review)
2. Include reproduction steps and environment details
3. Have clear fix strategy or investigation plan identified
4. Pass constitutional compliance review for severity escalation
5. Have sufficient technical detail for development planning

---

## Usage Notes

This backlog is maintained by:
- **`/Backlog/prioritize-bugs`**: Reviews and reorders based on severity and impact
- **Sprint planning**: Source of truth for bugs to include in development cycles
- **Quality assurance**: Tracking constitutional compliance and user impact
- **Release planning**: Critical bugs blocking releases, fix verification requirements

Bug flow: **Bugs-Inbox.md** → **Bugs-Backlog.md** → **Development Sprint** → **Fixed & Verified**
