## ü§î Why ContextKit exists

**The real problem**: AI assistants are reactive, not proactive. You have to spoon-feed them every single step: "Now create the model", "Now add the service", "Don't forget tests", "Now wire up the UI". They wait for instructions instead of understanding the bigger picture and driving the process forward.

**The frustration**: You're managing the AI instead of collaborating with it. You spend your time figuring out what to ask for next, breaking down work into AI-digestible chunks, and constantly steering the conversation. It's like having a junior developer who needs step-by-step instructions for everything.

**The solution**: ContextKit gives AI the planning intelligence to understand your project, suggest the right technical approach, break down features systematically, and guide you through proven development phases. The AI becomes a proactive partner that knows what comes next and why.

**And you stay in control**: ContextKit enables AI autonomy at the right moments while keeping you in strategic control. You review and approve the spec, tech decisions, and implementation plan at key checkpoints. The AI then executes with specialized quality agents (accessibility, localization, code cleanup) working autonomously within your approved framework.

**The key insight**: By helping AI understand your intent clearly upfront, it can work longer and more effectively without constant corrections. You spend time on strategic decisions, not fixing misunderstood implementations.

This isn't just "better prompts" - it's giving Claude Code the structured intelligence to plan, execute, and guide development workflows without constant hand-holding.

## ‚ö° Get started

### 1. Install ContextKit globally

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlineDev/ContextKit/main/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Setup your project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Initialize ContextKit (auto-detects your project type)
/ctxk:proj:init
```

### 3. Build your first feature systematically

```bash
# Step 1: Define what you're building (business requirements)
/ctxk:plan:1-spec "Add user authentication with Apple ID"

# Step 2: Plan the technical architecture
/ctxk:plan:2-tech

# Step 3: Break down into executable tasks
/ctxk:plan:3-steps

# Step 4: Start development with full context
/ctxk:impl:start-working
```

ContextKit creates structured feature directories, maintains context between sessions, and guides you through quality checkpoints that prevent common AI development pitfalls.

## üéØ How it transforms your workflow

### Before ContextKit
- ‚ùå **Constant hand-holding**: "Now create the model", "Now add tests", "Don't forget the service layer"
- ‚ùå **AI waits for instructions**: You have to figure out every next step and ask for it explicitly
- ‚ùå **Managing instead of collaborating**: You spend mental energy steering the AI, not building features
- ‚ùå **Fragmented development**: Jump between random tasks without systematic progression
- ‚ùå **Lost in complexity**: AI doesn't understand the full feature scope or technical implications
- ‚ùå **Reactive problem-solving**: Fix issues as they come up instead of preventing them

### After ContextKit
- ‚úÖ **AI drives the process**: Systematic phases guide you through spec ‚Üí tech ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí implementation
- ‚úÖ **Proactive planning**: AI suggests technical approaches and identifies potential issues early
- ‚úÖ **Adapts to your style**: Learns your patterns, tech preferences, and architectural decisions
- ‚úÖ **Context-aware development**: Understanding your project architecture and making smart decisions
- ‚úÖ **Structured progression**: Clear phases with built-in quality gates and validation
- ‚úÖ **Strategic control**: You approve the plan, AI executes with specialized quality agents
- ‚úÖ **Actually faster development**: Less time correcting, more time on architecture and decisions

## üèóÔ∏è The systematic approach

ContextKit implements a proven 4-phase methodology that prevents the chaos of unstructured AI development:

### Phase 1: Business Case (`/ctxk:plan:1-spec`)
Define **what** you're building and **why**, without technical details:
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Success metrics and validation points
- Explicit uncertainty marking (no AI guessing)
- Scope boundaries (what's included, what's not)

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture (`/ctxk:plan:2-tech`)
Plan **how** you'll build it, with constitutional compliance:
- Technology choices with rationale
- Swift/SwiftUI patterns and architectural decisions
- Accessibility, localization, and privacy considerations
- Integration with existing project patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation Tasks (`/ctxk:plan:3-steps`)
Break down **execution** into trackable work:
- File-by-file implementation tasks with S001-S999 numbering
- Parallel execution markers ([P]) for concurrent development
- Dependency chains and validation checkpoints
- Test-driven development task ordering

### Phase 4: Development (`/ctxk:impl:start-working`)
Execute with supervised autonomy and specialized quality agents:
- AI implements within your approved technical framework
- Specialized subagents handle quality checks (accessibility, localization, modern code)
- Automatic cleanup of AI artifacts (leftover comments, temporary code)
- You maintain strategic oversight while AI handles tactical execution

## ü§ñ Built-in Quality Agents

ContextKit includes specialized sub-agents that automatically ensure code quality at the right moments, working autonomously within your approved framework:

### Code Quality & Compliance
- **`check-accessibility`** - VoiceOver labels, color contrast, keyboard navigation, inclusive design patterns
- **`check-localization`** - String Catalog validation, cultural adaptation, region formatters, pluralization
- **`check-error-handling`** - ErrorKit patterns, typed throws, user-friendly error messages
- **`check-modern-code`** - Replace outdated APIs (Date() ‚Üí Date.now, TimeInterval ‚Üí Duration, async/await patterns)
- **`check-code-debt`** - Remove AI artifacts, consolidate patterns, extract reusable components
- **`build-project`** - Execute builds and report results without filling context with verbose output

These agents activate automatically during development phases, ensuring consistent quality without manual oversight.

## üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Principles

ContextKit is built on non-negotiable development principles embedded throughout all templates and workflows:

### Quality Gates
- **Accessibility-first**: VoiceOver support, dynamic type, color contrast built into every UI component
- **Privacy by design**: Privacy impact assessment, minimal data collection, user consent patterns
- **Localizability from day one**: String Catalog integration, cultural adaptation, region formatters
- **Platform-appropriate UX**: iOS/macOS Human Interface Guidelines, native patterns, platform conventions
- **Code maintainability**: Modern Swift practices, clean architecture, typed error handling

### Development Standards
- **Constitutional compliance**: All templates enforce these principles through validation gates
- **Quality over speed**: Built-in checks prevent technical debt and accessibility issues
- **Systematic approach**: Structured phases with explicit validation prevent common AI mistakes
- **Context preservation**: Smart agents keep sessions focused without verbose build output

## üîß Prerequisites

- **macOS, Linux, or WSL2** (wherever Claude Code runs)
- **Claude Code** - ContextKit is built specifically for Claude Code's advanced features (commands, hooks, subagents)
- **Git** - Required for project setup and context preservation

## üéØ Why Claude Code specifically?

ContextKit is built exclusively for Claude Code because it's currently the most advanced and mature agentic development system available. While other tools exist (Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex), Claude Code pioneered this space and offers unique features that make ContextKit possible:

- **Commands**: Custom `/ctxk:*` commands for structured workflows
- **Hooks**: Automatic code formatting and session management  
- **Subagents**: Specialized quality agents that work autonomously
- **Mature ecosystem**: Proven, stable platform for serious development work

Rather than abstracting across multiple tools, ContextKit leverages Claude Code's full feature set to deliver maximum productivity and reliability. But ContextKit could easily be forked and adjusted to the needs of other systems, given they also support commands, hooks, and subagents.

## üåç Universal but opinionated

ContextKit follows **convention over configuration** with smart defaults for Swift/iOS development, but adapts to any technology stack through its hierarchical system:

### Swift/iOS Projects (Default Experience)
- Constitutional principles: Package-first architecture, 3-space indentation, ErrorKit patterns
- Quality gates: Accessibility compliance, localization readiness, App Store guidelines
- Release workflows: Xcode Cloud integration, App Store Connect automation
- Code formatting: swift-format + SwiftFormat with consistent style

### Other Technologies (Workspace Overrides)
- **Python/Django**: Override global guidelines with Python-specific patterns
- **React/TypeScript**: Add TypeScript guidelines, ESLint/Prettier configs
- **Client Projects**: Workspace-level overrides for different coding standards
- **Universal Core**: Planning methodology and quality framework work everywhere

The **hierarchical context system** (Global ‚Üí Workspace ‚Üí Project) lets you maintain consistency across all projects while adapting to client requirements or technology differences.

## üß™ Built from real experience

ContextKit isn't theoretical - it's built from hundreds of hours developing iOS apps with AI assistants, learning from failures, and systematically improving the process:

### What I Learned
- **Hand-holding kills productivity**: Constantly figuring out what to ask the AI next wastes more time than coding manually
- **AI lacks planning intelligence**: Without structured phases, you get random code without strategic thinking
- **Context understanding is key**: AI needs to grasp your full project, not just the current task
- **Systematic beats reactive**: Preventing problems through planning is faster than fixing them later

### What I Built
- **Executable workflows**: Templates with explicit logic, validation gates, error conditions
- **Context preservation**: Features survive chat context limits through structured documentation
- **Quality enforcement**: Constitutional principles embedded in every template and command
- **Progress tracking**: S001-S999 task numbering enables precise communication and resumption

### Why It Works
ContextKit transforms AI from a powerful but unpredictable tool into a systematic development partner that **consistently** produces high-quality, maintainable code following your patterns and standards.

The result: **You build features faster, with fewer bugs, that follow your architecture, and work correctly the first time.**
