## ü§î Why ContextKit exists

**The real problem**: AI assistants are reactive, not proactive. You have to spoon-feed them every single step: "Now create the model", "Now add the service", "Don't forget tests", "Now wire up the UI". They wait for instructions instead of understanding the bigger picture and driving the process forward.

**The frustration**: You're managing the AI instead of collaborating with it. You spend your time figuring out what to ask for next, breaking down work into AI-digestible chunks, and constantly steering the conversation. It's like having a junior developer who needs step-by-step instructions for everything.

**The solution**: ContextKit gives AI the planning intelligence to understand your project, suggest the right technical approach, break down features systematically, and guide you through proven development phases. The AI becomes a proactive partner that knows what comes next and why.

**And you stay in control**: ContextKit enables AI autonomy at the right moments while keeping you in strategic control. You review and approve the spec, tech decisions, and implementation plan at key checkpoints. The AI then executes with specialized quality agents (accessibility, localization, code cleanup) working autonomously within your approved framework.

**The key insight**: By helping AI understand your intent clearly upfront, it can work longer and more effectively without constant corrections. You spend time on strategic decisions, not fixing misunderstood implementations.

## ‚ö° Get started

### 1. Install ContextKit globally

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlineDev/ContextKit/main/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Setup your project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Initialize ContextKit (auto-detects your project type)
/ctxk:proj:init
```

### 3. Build your first feature systematically

```bash
# Step 1: Define what you're building (business requirements)
/ctxk:plan:1-spec

# Step 2: Plan the technical architecture
/ctxk:plan:2-research-tech

# Step 3: Break down into executable tasks
/ctxk:plan:3-steps

# Step 4: Start development with full context
/ctxk:impl:start-working
```

ContextKit creates structured feature directories, maintains context between sessions, and guides you through quality checkpoints that prevent common AI development pitfalls.

> [!NOTE]
> **Early Development**: ContextKit is actively evolving with iterative improvements. While production-ready (I use it daily for all my projects), expect some rough edges as commands and agents are refined. ContextKit updates itself globally when you start new chats, and the `/ctxk:proj:migrate` command makes updating your project files easy - keep sending feedback to help iron out issues faster.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimized Configuration

ContextKit configures Claude Code with optimized settings for systematic development:

- **Sonnet Model Default**: Sufficient quality with proper guidance while reducing 5h-limit risk during complex planning phases
- **Custom Statusline**: Real-time monitoring so you have full transparency about the limits:
  ```
  5h-Usage: 73% (1.4h left) | Chat: ‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 64% (128k/200k)
  ```
  Progress bar colors: Light Gray (<50%), Yellow (50-80%), Red (>80%) for visual context awareness

> [!TIP]
> **Disable Auto-Compact for Better Control**
>
> Type `/config` in Claude and set "Auto-compact" to **false**. Auto-compact triggers at ~85% context usage, often interrupting you when nearly finished with a task and plenty of relevant context available.
>
> **Better workflow**: Start fresh chats when needed and resume with `/ctxk:impl:start-working` (within feature branches after planning) ‚Äì ContextKit's structured approach makes this seamless. Manual `/compact` loses unpredictable amounts of context, while fresh starts preserve your systematic progress.

## üèóÔ∏è How it works

ContextKit implements a proven 4-phase methodology that prevents the chaos of unstructured AI development:

### Phase 1: Business Case (`/ctxk:plan:1-spec`)
Define **what** you're building and **why**, without technical details:
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Success metrics and validation points
- Explicit uncertainty marking (no AI guessing)
- Scope boundaries (what's included, what's not)

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture (`/ctxk:plan:2-research-tech`)
Plan **how** you'll build it, with constitutional compliance:
- Technology choices with rationale
- Swift/SwiftUI patterns and architectural decisions
- Accessibility, localization, and privacy considerations
- Integration with existing project patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation Tasks (`/ctxk:plan:3-steps`)
Break down **execution** into trackable work:
- File-by-file implementation tasks with S001-S999 numbering
- Parallel execution markers ([P]) for concurrent development
- Dependency chains and validation checkpoints
- Test-driven development task ordering

### Phase 4: Development (`/ctxk:impl:start-working`)
Execute with supervised autonomy and specialized quality agents (requires feature branch + completed planning phases):
- AI implements within your approved technical framework
- Specialized agents handle quality checks (accessibility, localization, modern code)
- Automatic cleanup of AI artifacts (leftover comments, temporary code)
- You maintain strategic oversight while AI handles tactical execution

## ü§ñ Built-in Quality Agents

ContextKit includes specialized sub-agents that automatically ensure code quality at the right moments:

- **`check-accessibility`** - VoiceOver labels, color contrast, keyboard navigation, inclusive design patterns
- **`check-localization`** - String Catalog validation, cultural adaptation, region formatters, pluralization
- **`check-error-handling`** - ErrorKit patterns, typed throws, user-friendly error messages
- **`check-modern-code`** - Replace outdated APIs (Date() ‚Üí Date.now, TimeInterval ‚Üí Duration, async/await patterns)
- **`check-code-debt`** - Remove AI artifacts, consolidate patterns, extract reusable components
- **`build-project`** - Execute builds and report results without filling context with verbose output
- **`run-test-suite`** - Execute complete test suite with build validation and structured failure reporting
- **`run-specific-test`** - Execute specific test with build validation and focused failure analysis
- ... more to be added over time with updates!

These agents activate automatically during development phases, **adapting to your detected tech stack** for consistent quality without manual oversight.

## üîÑ Seamless Updates

ContextKit automatically checks for newer versions when you start a new session and displays update notifications if available ‚Äì but **never interrupts your workflow**. When you're ready to update:

- Simply type `/ctxk:proj:migrate` and ContextKit handles everything
- Your project customizations are preserved automatically
- Core templates update to the latest improvements
- New commands and agents are automatically added to your project
- Review all changes in Git before committing ‚Äì full transparency
- You stay in full control of when updates happen

## üîí Files Safe to Customize

**These files are NEVER updated by `/ctxk:proj:migrate` once created:**

### ‚úÖ Complete User Control (modify freely)
- **Formatter Config Files** (`.swift-format`, `.swiftformat`) - Your coding style preferences, never overwritten
- **Project Context** (`Context.md`) - Your project configuration, completely customizable
- **Feature Specifications** (`Context/Features/*/`) - Feature specs, research, tech plans, and steps are yours to edit
- **Workspace Context** (`[Workspace]/Context.md`) - Your workspace overrides, never touched

### ‚öôÔ∏è Partial Control (customization sections preserved)
- **Commands & Agents** - Core logic updates, but your additions in "üë©‚Äçüíª DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" sections are preserved
- **Guidelines** - Reference content updates, but your project-specific customizations are preserved

### üìù Backlog File Management
- **Inbox Files** (`Ideas-Inbox.md`, `Bugs-Inbox.md`) - **‚úÖ COMPLETELY USER-EDITABLE**: Edit manually, copy/paste between projects, add entries freely
- **Backlog Files** (`Ideas-Backlog.md`, `Bugs-Backlog.md`) - **‚ùå AI-MANAGED DATABASES**: Never edit directly! Request changes through `/ctxk:impl:start-working` sessions

**Bottom Line**: Your formatter configs, project context, features, and backlog content are completely yours. ContextKit only updates core frameworks and logic while preserving all your customizations.

## üéØ Why Claude Code

ContextKit is built exclusively for Claude Code because it's currently the most advanced and mature agentic development system available. While other tools exist (Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex), Claude Code pioneered this space and offers unique features that make ContextKit possible:

- **Commands**: Custom `/ctxk:*` commands for structured workflows
- **Hooks**: Automatic code formatting and session management  
- **Agents**: Specialized quality agents that work autonomously
- **Mature ecosystem**: Proven, stable platform for serious development work

Rather than abstracting across multiple tools, ContextKit leverages Claude Code's full feature set to deliver maximum productivity and reliability. But ContextKit could easily be forked and adjusted to the needs of other systems, given they also support commands, hooks, and agents.

## üåç Universal but opinionated

ContextKit is **genuinely platform-agnostic** through intelligent project detection and adaptive workflows:

### üîç **Automatic Platform Detection**
When you run `/ctxk:proj:init`, ContextKit analyzes your project and documents everything in `Context.md`:
- **Technology stack**: React/TypeScript, Swift/SwiftUI, Kotlin/Android, Python/Django, etc.
- **Build system**: npm scripts, Xcode, Gradle, Maven, etc.
- **Dependencies**: package.json, Podfile, build.gradle, requirements.txt
- **Project structure**: Monorepo, multi-module, single-app architecture

This `Context.md` becomes the source of truth that **every ContextKit command reads** to understand your specific setup.

### üéØ **Adaptive Command Execution**
Commands automatically adapt to your detected platform:
- **`build-project` agent**: Uses `xcodebuild` for iOS, `gradle build` for Android, `npm run build` for web
- **Quality checks**: Runs `swift-format` for Swift (with included configs), or your platform's linters
- **Release workflows**: App Store for iOS, Play Store for Android, Vercel/Netlify for web

### üìã **Platform-Specific Guidelines & Configs**
- **Currently available**: `Swift.md`, `SwiftUI.md` guidelines + Swift formatting configs (battle-tested from production apps)
- **Community contributions welcome**: `React.md`, `Kotlin.md`, `Python.md` guidelines + your platform's formatter configs
- **Project customization**: All commands/agents/templates include a "üë©‚Äçüíª DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section for project-specific overrides (preserved during updates)

**The result**: ContextKit feels native to YOUR tech stack while maintaining systematic development methodology across all platforms.

### Example: Cross-Platform Feature Development
```bash
# Same commands, different execution based on your Context.md:

# React Project:
/ctxk:plan:2-research-tech  # Suggests React patterns, considers Next.js/Vite
/ctxk:impl:start-working    # Reads React.md guidelines, runs npm commands

# Android Project:
/ctxk:plan:2-research-tech  # Suggests Kotlin patterns, considers Jetpack Compose
/ctxk:impl:start-working    # Reads Kotlin.md guidelines, runs gradle commands

# Swift Project:
/ctxk:plan:2-research-tech  # Suggests SwiftUI patterns, considers iOS guidelines
/ctxk:impl:start-working    # Reads Swift.md guidelines, runs xcodebuild
```

The **hierarchical context system** (Global ‚Üí Workspace ‚Üí Project) lets you maintain consistency across all projects while adapting to client requirements or technology differences.

## üß™ Built from real experience

ContextKit isn't theoretical - it's built from hundreds of hours developing iOS apps with AI assistants, learning from failures, and systematically improving the process:

### What I Learned
- **Hand-holding kills productivity**: Constantly figuring out what to ask the AI next wastes more time than coding manually
- **AI lacks planning intelligence**: Without structured phases, you get random code without strategic thinking
- **Context understanding is key**: AI needs to grasp your full project, not just the current task
- **Systematic beats reactive**: Preventing problems through planning is faster than fixing them later

### What I Built
- **Executable workflows**: Templates with explicit logic, validation gates, error conditions
- **Context preservation**: Features survive chat context limits through structured documentation
- **Quality enforcement**: Constitutional principles embedded in every template and command
- **Progress tracking**: S001-S999 task numbering enables precise communication and resumption

### Why It Works
ContextKit transforms AI from a powerful but unpredictable tool into a systematic development partner that **consistently** produces high-quality, maintainable code following your patterns and standards.

The result: **You build features faster, with fewer bugs, that follow your architecture, and work correctly the first time.**

## Contributing

### Template Versioning

For behavioral changes (not typos), update the line 2 header in each modified file:
- Increment **Template Version** number
- Update **Updated** date to current date

For releases, update **ContextKit** version in all template files.

### Custom Development Standards

ContextKit is opinionated about coding style (3-space indentation, explicit `self.`) and framework choices (FlineDevKit ecosystem with ErrorKit, HandySwift, etc.). If the developer customization sections aren't enough for your needs, fork this repository, modify the guidelines and templates, and update the migrate command in `Templates/Commands/proj/migrate.md` to point to your custom repo URL.
