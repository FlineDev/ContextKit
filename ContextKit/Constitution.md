# ContextKit Constitutional Framework

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Effective**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Non-negotiable development principles

## Preamble

This document establishes the **non-negotiable development principles** that form the constitutional foundation of ContextKit. These principles are embedded in every template, command, hook, and subagent to ensure consistent, high-quality software development that prioritizes accessibility, privacy, localizability, and maintainability.

Unlike guidelines that may be adapted for specific contexts, these constitutional principles are **invariant** across all projects, workspaces, and technology stacks using ContextKit.

## Article I: Accessibility-First Design

**Principle**: Accessibility is not a feature to be added laterâ€”it is the foundation upon which all software is built.

### Constitutional Requirements

**Section 1.1 - Universal Design Mandate**
- All user interfaces MUST be designed for the widest possible range of users from conception
- Accessibility considerations MUST be present in Phase 0 specifications (before any technical implementation)
- No feature may be implemented that creates barriers for users with disabilities

**Section 1.2 - Technical Implementation Standards**
- All interactive elements MUST have appropriate accessibility labels and hints
- Color MUST never be the sole means of conveying information
- All functionality MUST be available via keyboard navigation
- Dynamic Type MUST be supported for all text content
- VoiceOver navigation MUST be logical and efficient

**Section 1.3 - Validation Gates**
- Templates MUST include accessibility validation before completion
- The `check-accessibility` subagent MUST pass before any UI implementation is considered complete
- Constitutional violations regarding accessibility are **blocking issues** that prevent feature release

**Section 1.4 - Platform Compliance**
- iOS/macOS projects MUST follow Human Interface Guidelines accessibility requirements
- Web projects MUST achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- All platforms MUST provide accessible alternatives for complex interactions

---

## Article II: Privacy by Design

**Principle**: User privacy is a fundamental right that must be protected through technical architecture, not policy promises.

### Constitutional Requirements

**Section 2.1 - Data Minimization Mandate**
- Applications MUST collect only data that is essential for core functionality
- All data collection MUST be explicitly justified in feature specifications
- Data retention MUST have defined expiration and deletion processes
- User consent MUST be meaningful and granular, never bundled or coercive

**Section 2.2 - Technical Implementation Standards**
- Privacy Manifests MUST be updated whenever new data collection is introduced
- All data storage MUST be encrypted at rest where technically feasible
- Network communications MUST use secure protocols (TLS 1.3 minimum)
- User data MUST never be accessible to unauthorized parties, including developers

**Section 2.3 - Transparency Requirements**
- Users MUST understand what data is collected and why
- Privacy settings MUST be easily accessible and clearly explained
- Data sharing MUST require explicit user consent for each recipient
- Privacy policies MUST be written in plain language

**Section 2.4 - Technical Safeguards**
- Default settings MUST favor user privacy
- Features MUST work with minimal data collection
- Analytics MUST be privacy-preserving (e.g., TelemetryDeck's no-PII approach)
- Third-party integrations MUST undergo privacy impact assessment

## Article III: Localizability from Day One

**Principle**: Software must be designed for global use from the first line of code, not retrofitted later.

### Constitutional Requirements

**Section 3.1 - Internationalization Architecture**
- No user-facing strings may be hardcoded in source code
- All text MUST use semantic keys in localization systems
- Date, number, and currency formatting MUST use system regional preferences
- Sort order and text processing MUST respect locale conventions

**Section 3.2 - Cultural Considerations**
- User interface layouts MUST support right-to-left languages
- Color symbolism and imagery MUST be culturally appropriate
- Feature design MUST consider different cultural contexts and usage patterns
- Text expansion/contraction MUST be accounted for in UI design

**Section 3.3 - Technical Implementation Standards**
- Swift projects MUST use String Catalogs (.xcstrings) for localization
- All localization keys MUST have contextual comments for translators
- Pluralization rules MUST be properly implemented using .stringsdict files
- TranslateKit integration is preferred for AI-assisted localization workflows

**Section 3.4 - Quality Assurance**
- The `check-localization` subagent MUST validate all user-facing content
- Pseudolocalization testing MUST be performed during development
- At minimum, applications MUST be localized for the developer's target markets
- Localization MUST never be an afterthought or post-release addition

---

## Article IV: Code Maintainability

**Principle**: Code must be written for humans to read, understand, and modify, not just for computers to execute.

### Constitutional Requirements

**Section 4.1 - Clarity and Simplicity**
- Code MUST prioritize readability over clever optimization
- Complex logic MUST be broken down into smaller, understandable functions
- Swift projects MUST prefer SwiftUI over UIKit for new development
- Package-first architecture is MANDATORY for reusable functionality

**Section 4.2 - Error Handling Standards**
- Swift projects MUST use typed throws with ErrorKit patterns
- Error messages MUST be user-friendly through the Throwable protocol
- Error propagation MUST use the Catching protocol for consistent handling
- UI error states MUST display meaningful information, not technical details

**Section 4.3 - Code Organization Principles**
- One responsibility per function, class, or module
- Dependencies MUST be explicit and minimized
- Architectural patterns MUST be consistent within a project
- Documentation MUST be present for all public APIs and complex logic

**Section 4.4 - Quality Standards**
- Code formatting MUST be automated and consistent (SwiftFormat + swift-format)
- The `check-modern-code` subagent MUST approve all implementations
- The `check-code-debt` subagent MUST clean up AI-generated artifacts
- Technical debt MUST be addressed systematically, not accumulated

## Article V: Platform-Appropriate User Experience

**Principle**: Software must embrace platform conventions and provide experiences that feel native to each environment.

### Constitutional Requirements

**Section 5.1 - Platform Integration**
- iOS/macOS applications MUST follow Human Interface Guidelines
- Applications MUST use system-provided components where appropriate
- Navigation patterns MUST be familiar to platform users
- Performance MUST meet platform expectations (60fps UI, fast launch times)

**Section 5.2 - System Integration**
- Applications MUST integrate with platform accessibility services
- System preferences MUST be respected (Dark Mode, Dynamic Type, Reduce Motion)
- Platform capabilities MUST be leveraged appropriately (CloudKit, HealthKit, Shortcuts)
- App Store Guidelines compliance is MANDATORY for all published applications

**Section 5.3 - Cross-Platform Considerations**
- Shared code MUST not compromise platform-specific user experiences
- UI adaptations MUST feel natural on each target platform
- Performance characteristics MUST be optimized for each platform's constraints
- Platform-specific features MUST be gracefully handled when unavailable

## Article VI: Anti-Speculation and Evidence-Based Development

**Principle**: Development decisions must be based on evidence and clear requirements, not speculation about future needs.

### Constitutional Requirements

**Section 6.1 - Requirements Clarity**
- All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers MUST be resolved before implementation
- Features MUST have measurable success criteria
- User value MUST be explicitly defined and validated
- Scope boundaries MUST be clearly documented (in-scope, out-of-scope, future)

**Section 6.2 - Implementation Focus**
- Only implement features that solve current, validated user problems
- Avoid "future-proofing" and premature optimization
- Prefer simple solutions that can be enhanced later over complex initial implementations
- Remove unused code and dependencies regularly

**Section 6.3 - Validation Requirements**
- All assumptions MUST be documented and validated
- Technical decisions MUST have clear justification
- Feature complexity MUST be justified by user value
- Implementation approaches MUST be the simplest that meet requirements

## Article VII: Constitutional Enforcement

**Principle**: These constitutional principles must be actively enforced through technical mechanisms, not just policy.

### Constitutional Requirements

**Section 7.1 - Template Enforcement**
- All ContextKit templates MUST embed constitutional compliance gates
- Templates MUST refuse to complete if constitutional principles are violated
- Constitutional violations are **blocking issues** that prevent feature progression
- Justification is required for any constitutional principle override

**Section 7.2 - Automated Validation**
- Subagents MUST validate constitutional compliance automatically

- Hooks MUST enforce constitutional principles during development
- Manual validation MUST supplement automated checks

**Section 7.3 - Escalation and Resolution**
- Constitutional conflicts MUST be escalated to project leadership
- Violations MUST be documented with rationale if overridden

## Amendment Process

This constitutional framework may only be modified through the following process:

1. **Proposal**: Constitutional amendment must be formally documented with rationale
2. **Impact Assessment**: All affected projects and teams must be identified
3. **Review Period**: Minimum 30-day review period for community feedback
4. **Approval**: Amendment must be approved by ContextKit maintainers
5. **Implementation**: Migration path and timeline must be defined
6. **Communication**: All users must be notified of constitutional changes

## Compliance and Enforcement

**Constitutional Status**: These principles override all other guidelines, preferences, and conventions when conflicts arise.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**: 
- Template validation gates
- Subagent quality checks  
- Hook automation
- Manual review processes
- Community accountability

**Violation Response**:
- **Critical**: Implementation must stop until resolved
- **Major**: Resolution required before release
